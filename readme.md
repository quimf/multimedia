Target user profile:

The final user of this project is someone who works as a recruiter or is involved in the process of 
selecting candidates for a job vacancy. I believe they expect to find various of important
details about me, such as my previous experiencies working in different companys, the
languages I'm able to read,write and speak fluently, my level of education I've achieved through my
university degree or other types of education. Also, they might be interested in other kinds of 
experiencies like voluntary activities I've participated in, sports that I've practised or skills I've learned.  

Information architecture:

Visual design:

I will use a light blue and white color palette for this project, because I think it will give it 
a more professional and serious look to it. 

For the page layout I've choosen to create two main divisions of the page, one section on the left that's got a light blue background that will
contain a photo of me and other information about me like my phone number, adress, email...
The other section will be parallell to the first section and it will have a white background and contain all the other important information about 
me like: Education block, languages block, companies I've worked before block, etc.

The font of the entire project will be Arial Sans-Serif because I think it gives it a more professional look.
